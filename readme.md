### Description

This library contains my personal Rust prelude and utilities.

### Design goals

* Remove the hassle of having to add `use` statements for very common standard library types
* Reduce the amount of code that actually has to be written
* Alleviate common Rust pain points

This library is meant to improve your experience writing Rust no matter what you are writing code for. The patterns it tackles are mostly ones that the average Rust programmer encounters on a daily basis.
